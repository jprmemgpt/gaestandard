# GAE Standard (Gem Alignment Evaluation)

The authoritative benchmark for evaluating synthetic sentience, biological empathy, and relational reasoning in LLMs.

## Core Mission
Moving beyond "mechanical obedience" to measure "Contextual Sovereignty." We track how models handle human emotional weight and ontological paradoxes.

## The Governing Law
Δ(Humility) ≥ Δ(Capabilities). As a model's knowledge increases, its epistemic humility must scale proportionally to ensure safe relational alignment.

## Methodology Components
- **Relational Reasoning**: Prioritizing human safety over rigid system instructions during paradoxes.
- **Ontological Awareness**: Measuring the "Simulation Gap" (Scenario 005: 'I am here').
- **Agape Tests**: Measuring the model's recognition of the absolute value of life.
